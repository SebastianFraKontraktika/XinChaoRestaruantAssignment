## website for Xin Chào restaurant

## what is this for?

---

this is a website for the restaurant as a week loong assignment. It is supposed to be a website for the Xin Chào restaurant in Oslo, and is supposed to be an easy way to check the meny online, how you're supposed to get there and how you could contact the restaurant. Such are the three main focus by me on this project, It will have a google maps integration, a meny and contact information.

## contributation

I will admit, the actual content as of now? Very bare. So if, again for some reason, this website is in use, you are fully allowed to change, for example; what the paragraphs say, what pictures are used and such. For pictures you find the img tag with the current picture and then change the url with the new picture. Same with text, find the paragraph in the code and then change it to whatever you want.
